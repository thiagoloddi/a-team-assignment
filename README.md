# a-team-assignment

This is a React + TypeScript assignment for the joining process on the A Team platform.

This application has one only page, where a list of projects is shown. The user is able to edit, delete and create new projects. It's also possible to filter the projects by title using the search bar on the top of the page.

Upon saving the changes, the new data should be stored on localStorage to be retrieved on later access.

All the UI should be fully responsive for multiple window sizes.
